# BoxLine: Documentation
The game is based on the player's reaction to touch the screen and place the box inside a straight line of the wall. Through achieving more and more points, the player gets a possibility to compete on the local (national) and global (world) level, which becomes visible on the score lists. Throughout the game, the player has several options; unlocking various achievements, buying various players with differing abilities, or playing multiplayer where they can compete with other players on the server.

## Splash Screen
The splash screen is the first thing displayed after the user launches the application. It is divided into two views where the first, the basic text of which is the "loading boxes", is a loading/ preparing application. The second screen is a cleaning of the first one with animated boxes, which reveals my co-worker who made music and sound effects for the app. The animation lasts for 10 seconds, whereupon the user comes to the main screen named "Home". The animated boxes represent currently selected box by the user, as can be seen on the 3rd image below this text.

 ## Home Screen
After the splash screen, the user is navigated to the main "Home" screen. The background is animated all the time by moving the selected box behind the clouds. When switching between singleplayer and multiplayer, the UI is updatet to represent the selected mode.

From this point, we can navigate to several screens:
- Game
- Multiplayer
- Players
- Scores 
- Achievements 
- Options 
- Shop 
- Remove Ads

## Game Screen
This screen shows the game of this application. User can enter this screen from "Home" or "Multiplayer". The main goal is to try to stop your box inside the wall. When hitting inside the wall repeatedly in a row, after 4 hits user starts collecting coins. As time goes by and the user gets more coins, the level increases as the speed of the box increases and it becomes more and more difficult to place it accurately in the wall and get coins. It is possible to bounce off the wall several times, however, afterwards, a bomb is shown on the opposite wall as an obstacle, and hitting it means to lose one life. After losing all lives, an end screen will open, with three options: home, restart, or getting extra life by watching ads or using diamonds. On this screen, it can be seen if extra achievements are unlocked, whether the player made a new high score or the player can share their current score. At the end of the first game played, a user is given the opportunity to register their name. The name does not have to be permanent and can be changed in options.

 ## Multiplayer Screen
While selecting a multiplayer mode on the "Home" screen, the user can select the type of arena of their interest. The arenas work by using a certain amount of coins and trying to almost double it. The user can set up three scores and wait for other players to match one of his scores and try to win or lose. At the bottom, there is a "Find a match" button that will search for available results that you can try to win.
