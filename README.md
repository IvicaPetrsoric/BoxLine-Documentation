## Game screen
This screen shows the game of this application. User can enter this screen from "Home" or "Multiplayer". The main goal is to try to stop your box inside the wall. While stopping inside the wall, the coin bar is fulled. When hitting inside the wall repeatedly in a row, after 4 hits user starts collecting coins. As time goes and the user gains more coins the level is increased and therefore is the speed of box and even the precision for stopping in the wall to gain coins is much smalle. You can bounce from the wall a few times but after that, on the opposite wall, an obstacle (bomb) will show and if you hit it you lose one life. After you lose all lives, the end screen is shown where you have three decisions to make: home, restart or gain on extra life with watching Ads or using diamonds. On this screen, you can see if extra achievements are unlocked, made a new high score or share your current score. When in first time run during the game, at the end of game user gains the ability to register his name. The name isn't permanent and can be changed inside options.
